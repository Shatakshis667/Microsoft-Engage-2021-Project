## üéØ Overview 

#### ‚Ä£ Given Problem statement:
Build a functional prototype of a platform that gives students an array of digital academic and social tools to stay engaged with their studies, peers and broader university community during pandemic.

#### ‚Ä£ Project Idea:
The COVID-19 Pandemic has changed the education system dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Even the exams are being held in a remote fashion. Thus, this project provides an integrated platform for the students as well as the teachers to conduct examinations digitally in a hassle-free manner. One can create, attempt and monitor tests, and maintain score records easily.  
This project has been built solely during the period of **Microsoft Engage'21 Mentorship Program** conducted by Microsoft to provide mentorship and to enrich students with various software development techniques.

## üéØ Agile methology and workflow:
Agile methodology was followed by implementation of a sprint of 5 days in a week for 3 weeks along with continuous integration and development using Git version control. The website has been hosted on Heroku. The intent of the project, customer viewpoint, visual hierarchy and comfortable colour scheme were in mind while developing this project. Bugs were solved according to priority scale.

Priority scale : P0 (Maximum) to P4 (Minimum)

## üéØ Installation/Environment Setup:

  Prerequisites For Running The Project Locally:
  <pre>‚Ä¢ Node     ‚Ä¢ NPM     ‚Ä¢ Git </pre>
 
  #### 1. Clone App
  
   Create a new folder and clone the repository there using the following command: 
  
  ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/Shatakshis667/Microsoft-Engage-2021-Project.git
  ```
    
 #### 2. Backend Set-Up and Installations:
 
   Head inside the cloned folder and install the dependencies using npm:
  ```
   $ npm install 
  ```
 
   Next, create a .env file in the root of the project directory and  put all the config keys in this manner:
  ```
   JWT_SECRET = 
   MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME = 
   MONGODB_USERNAME = 
   MONGODB_PASSWORD = 
  ```
 
   Now, to start the backend server run:
  ```
    $ node index.js
  ```
 
#### 3. Frontend Set-Up and Installations:
 
   Head to the client side:
  ```
    $ cd client/
    $ cd ep-client/
  ```
 
   Install the dependencies using npm:
  ```
    $ npm install
  ```
 
   Finally, run:
  ```
    $ npm start
  ```
  
 ###### NOTE: It would automatically spin up a development server for you on ```PORT:3000``` & backend server on ```PORT 5000```
